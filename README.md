# yast2-dark-theme
Yast 2 style.qss modified installation.qss to dark theme


To replace the default style of Yast2, just swap in the style.qss in this repo on this path: ```/usr/share/YaST2/theme/current/wizard/style.qss``` 


Alternatively you can use different name of .qss file and it will show up on the style lists inside yast.
